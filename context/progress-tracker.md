  - Installed and integrated `html-to-image` for canvas image exports (PNG, SVG).
  - Added advanced shapes (Triangle, Star, Parallelogram, Block Arrow, Custom icon node, Group Container).
  - Implemented full shape customization: background colors, border styles (solid, dashed, dotted), opacity (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%), shadows (none, soft, medium, hard).
  - Added layer/zIndex management (Bring to Front, Send to Back) on right-click context menu and toolbar.

  - Added floating alignment (Align Left, Center, Right, Top, Middle, Bottom) and group/ungroup containers.
  - Added import and export utilities for JSON representation of the canvas graphs.
  - Supported context menus on right-clicking nodes, edges, and pane.
  - Refactored layout controls: Zoom/History/Grid on bottom-left, Import/Export/Saved status on bottom-right, basic shapes in a left-aligned vertical sidebar, and containers/special/text shapes in a bottom-center horizontal bar to prevent overlap and match standard diagramming interfaces.
  - Fixed Clerk authentication UI readability issues (low contrast text and icons on dark backgrounds in UserButton popover, UserProfile modal, and Sign-in/Sign-up cards) by updating config to use Clerk v7 CSS variables, adding fallback variables for compatibility, setting `cssLayerName="clerk"` to prevent CSS conflicts, and applying body-prepended, high-specificity global CSS overrides targeting action buttons, nav items, and their descendant elements.
- Resolved Prisma Client generation and Vercel deployment issue by migrating the generator provider in `prisma/schema.prisma` from the legacy `prisma-client-js` to the standard Prisma v7 `prisma-client`, outputting the client outside the scanned `prisma/` folder to `../generated/prisma` to avoid recursive schema parsing conflicts, updating the import path in `lib/prisma.ts`, and updating `.gitignore`.
- Fixed Vercel build crash caused by invalid or placeholder Liveblocks secret keys by adding active validation for the required `"sk_"` prefix in `lib/liveblocks.ts` and falling back to a dummy key during build/evaluation time if needed.

## Open Questions

- [Any unresolved product or technical decisions]

## Architecture Decisions

- `TaskRun` tracks Trigger.dev run IDs by `projectId` and `userId` so public run
  tokens can be issued only to the user who started the design run.
- The design agent mutates the existing Liveblocks React Flow storage with
  `mutateFlow` instead of introducing separate canvas state.
- AI progress uses a room-scoped Liveblocks feed named `ai-status-feed`; the
  task also broadcasts matching room events for realtime listeners.
- Active room UI shares one Liveblocks provider at the editor layout level so
  sidebar status/presence and canvas state observe the same room context.

## Session Notes

- `POST /api/ai/design` currently requires the authenticated project owner and
  treats `roomId` as the project ID, matching the existing Liveblocks room model.
- During build verification, the canvas API route params were updated to the
  Next.js 16 async route context signature and the stale `trigger.dev.config.ts`
  file was removed in favor of the active `trigger.config.ts`.
- The design agent defaults to `OPENROUTER_MODEL` when set, otherwise
  `google/gemini-2.5-flash` through OpenRouter.
- Liveblocks `setPresence` can fail independently of storage mutation; the
  design task now treats AI presence as non-critical and continues generation.
- OpenRouter generation is capped at 2048 output tokens by default to stay
  within low-credit account limits.
- Gemini/OpenRouter does not receive a complex JSON schema for design planning;
  the task requests JSON text and validates the action plan locally.
